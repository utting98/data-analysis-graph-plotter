# data-analysis-graph-plotter
This code is a GUI wrapper around polyfit and scipy curve optimize to easily allow users to plot polynomial and custom law graphs. The code gives values for fitting parameters with uncertainties and reduced chi squared values for data analysis and comparison with theory.
